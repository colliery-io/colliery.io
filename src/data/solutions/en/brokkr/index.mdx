# Brokkr

**Automate Your Infrastructure. Monitor Your Craft.**

**Brokkr** is your always-on workshop foreman — managing infrastructure state, watching for drift, and keeping your clusters in line with your desired configuration. Designed for teams that build, scale, and operate real-world systems, Brokkr delivers robust state reconciliation for Kubernetes, driven by code.

## Why Brokkr?

In Norse mythology, Brokkr is the smith who forged tools for the gods. In our world, **Brokkr** is the engine that forges reliability into your systems. It’s a durable, developer-first solution for managing infrastructure over time — not just during provisioning.

Where configuration drifts and manual patching lead to entropy, Brokkr brings precision, repeatability, and resilience.

## Built for the Operator

At Colliery, we build tools that work as hard as the people who use them. Brokkr is made for platform engineers, SREs, and developers who live close to the metal.

It doesn’t just provision. It watches. It corrects. It protects.

**State, enforced. Drift, resolved.**
