## What is Brokkr?

Brokkr is an environment-aware control plane that dynamically distributes Kubernetes objects across multiple clusters based on real-time conditions. It enables infrastructure teams to define resource stacks and intelligently deploy
them according to policies, environmental factors, and cluster capabilities.

## Key Features:
- Dynamic Resource Distribution: Deploy workloads to the right clusters based on policy definitions and real-time conditions
- Centralized Multi-Cluster Management: Control numerous Kubernetes environments from a single pane of glass
- Intelligent Policy Engine: Automatically route resources based on fully customizable policy definitions
- Lightweight Agent Architecture: Non-intrusive agents connect your clusters while maintaining their autonomy
- GitOps Compatible: Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and version control workflows
- Comprehensive API: RESTful interfaces for seamless integration with your existing tools

## Benefits:
- Reduce Operational Complexity: Manage multiple environments with consistent policies and automation
- Improve Deployment Reliability: Test once, deploy anywhere with environment-specific configurations handled automatically
- Enable Advanced Deployment Patterns: Support for red-black, canary, and progressive rollouts across environments
- Enhance Security & Compliance: Enforce consistent policies across all clusters with comprehensive audit trails
- Scale With Confidence: Add new environments or clusters without multiplying management overhead

## Use Cases:
- Multi-environment management (dev/staging/prod, regional deployments)
- Edge computing and distributed systems
- Hybrid cloud orchestration
- Deployment automation with advanced patterns
- Configuration and compliance management
- Platform orchestration and lifecycle management for distributed applications
