# Cloacina

**Build Resilient Workflows. Execute With Confidence.**

**Cloacina** is your embedded workflow engine — orchestrating complex multi-step processes directly within your Rust applications. No message queues, no external orchestrators. Just rock-solid task pipelines with automatic retries, PostgreSQL-backed state persistence, and dependency resolution built right into your codebase.

## Use Cases

- **Data Processing Pipelines**  
  Build ETL workflows that survive failures, restart from checkpoints, and scale with your data.

- **Background Job Systems**  
  Execute long-running tasks with automatic retries, progress tracking, and graceful recovery.

- **Integration Workflows**  
  Orchestrate complex business processes across systems with type-safe data flow and dependency management.

---

## Key Features

- **Embedded Framework**  
  Integrates directly into your Rust applications — no external orchestrators or workflow services required.

- **Resilient by Design**  
  Automatic retries with configurable backoff strategies, failure recovery, and PostgreSQL-backed state persistence.

- **Type-Safe Workflows**  
  Compile-time validation of task dependencies and data flow using Rust's type system and custom macros.

- **Content-Versioned Execution**  
  Automatic workflow versioning based on task code and structure — know exactly what changed and when.

---

## Get Started

- **Define Your Tasks**  
  Use Cloacina's `#[task]` macro to define async functions with retry policies and dependencies.

- **Build Your Workflow**  
  Compose tasks into workflows using the `workflow!` macro for type-safe orchestration.

- **Execute and Monitor**  
  Let Cloacina handle scheduling, state persistence, and recovery while you focus on business logic.

## Why Cloacina?

In Roman mythology, Cloacina was the goddess who presided over the sewers and drains — the hidden infrastructure that kept the city functioning. In our world, **Cloacina** is the hidden orchestration layer that keeps your applications running smoothly.

Where ad-hoc scripts and manual processes lead to fragility, Cloacina brings systematic reliability. It doesn't just run your tasks — it remembers their state, recovers from failures, and ensures your workflows complete successfully.

**State, persisted. Dependencies, resolved. Failures, recovered.**

## Built for the Builder

At Colliery, we build tools for developers who live in the code. Cloacina is made for backend engineers, data engineers, and systems architects who need workflows that work as hard as they do.

It doesn't run in a separate service. It lives in your application. It doesn't add operational complexity. It removes it.

Your workflows. Your database. Your control.

**Workflows, embedded. Execution, resilient.**
